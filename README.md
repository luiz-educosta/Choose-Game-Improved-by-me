# Choose Game Improved byme
***
A game inspired in an **Course** that i made from **Alura**. I'm getting knowldge in **C Language**, **GIT** and **GitHub**, 
and i think that way it was a good idea to praticat this.

I learned about ASCII art (not so much important to coding, but this gives a bealtfull in the game), declare variable, how to generate a random number, and other little cool things.

To improve my coding, i tried to use soome functions.

By the way, i'm Happy to improve my English too of course.

**Thanks to visit my repository!**
